# SDM-Based-Habitat-Suitability-for-Mule-Deer-in-British-Columbia
This project models habitat suitability for mule deer in British Columbia using a species distribution modeling (SDM) approach.
A Maxnet model was built using verified occurrence records and key environmental predictors—elevation, minimum winter temperature, and distance to urban areas—to map areas of higher and lower suitability. The results highlight the strong influence of winter climate on mule deer distribution and demonstrate how GIS-based modeling can support wildlife management and conservation planning.
